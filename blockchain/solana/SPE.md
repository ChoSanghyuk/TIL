# Solana Permissioned Environments



SPEs deliver the following differences:

- **Full Control**: Unlike mainnet, operators of SPEs have full control over the network's participants, infrastructure, and consensus mechanisms. They can define the network's validator set to ensure all network participants are known and meet necessary compliance standards.
- **Infrastructure Sovereignty**: Operators of SPEs can host their own nodes for direct control or strategically allocate node management responsibilities to specific partners. This enables a high degree of flexibility in shaping the network's physical infrastructure.
- **Adaptable Consensus**: To match the needs of a particular use case, SPEs can be configured with a variety of consensus mechanisms or opt for an alternative consensus algorithm. This adaptability is ideal when working within strict regulatory constraints or specific business logic.
