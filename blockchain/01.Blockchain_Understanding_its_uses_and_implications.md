# Blockchain: Understanding Its Uses and Implications



## Introduaction to Blockchain



### Introduction to Blockchain and The Early Internet

Blockchain is a peer-to-peer ledger system that allows peers to transact directly with each other eliminating the need for a central authority. 



At its core, blockchain is a system for recording information about a transaction in a new decentralized way that makes it difficult or impossible to alter. These transactions are stored on sheets or blocks in a digital ledger that is shared among the participants of the network. Consensus on the transactions brings the peer-to-peer network into an agreement. Once agreed upon, these transactions are grouped in blocks, and blocks of transactions are recorded in the immutable ledger.



The Internet can be grouped into three distinct segments characterized by how people interact with this new technology.

- Web 1.0 - Internet of Connection
  - Development of a host of web-based applications, which fostered online services, such as email.
  - Managed by a Central Authority.
  - Read-only, information was “pushed” to users.
- Web 2.0 - Internet of Information
  - User-generated content.
  - Read-write, individuals can interact with information.
  - 
- Web 3.0 - Internet of Value
  - Community interaction
  - More connected, open, and intelligent
  - Identity and information will be held by the individual, breaking data silos.
  - Blockchain will exchange value in the form of tokens (fungible and non-fungible)

The "Internet of Value" represents a world where value is exchanged at the speed at which information moves today. 



### Blockchain Basics



A block on a blockchain can be thought of much like a page in a notebook. Data is stored on a block. the digital ledger doesn't care what kind of information you're putting on it. So, while most of what we're recording today are financial transactions, we could also record things like voting records and results, land titling and medical records, etc. What makes this blockchain notebook incredibly powerful is that all the pages are linked together. So that if you go back and try and change any data on any page anywhere in this notebook, you break a link in a very obvious and easy-to-determine way.



A block on a blockchain can be thought of much like a page in a notebook. Data is stored on a block. This provides immutability and security.



Blockchain is a combination of several other underlying technologies that have never been combined so successfully. Here are some features that make this new technology so revolutionary.



- Distributed Ledger
  - A ledger is a collection of transactions
  - no one owns the ledger. The ledger is distributed among participants in the network, all running the same blockchain protocols
  - It is decentralized in that an identical copy of the ledger exists on every node/computer on the network
- Peer To Peer
  - The ledger is stored, updated, and maintained by a peer network
  - They store, spread and preserve the blockchain data, so a blockchain exists on nodes
  - ll nodes on a network follow the same rules of operation or protocols, but nodes have different roles. 
    - A full node contains a copy of the blockchain protocol, transaction history of the blockchain and aids in the maintenance of the blockchain. 
    - User node interacts with the ledger.
  - With blockchain technology, a lack of a centralized authority is replaced with a peer-to-peer network.
- Transparency
  - we can see all the transactions that have occurred on the shared or distributed ledger
  - Since every node shares a copy of the agreed-upon ledger, there is no friction about the transactions, everyone has the same agreed-upon copy.
  - Centralized systems are not transparent, the information about the ledger is controlled by one authority.
- Consensus
  - Blockchain ledgers are different from centralized ledgers because network participants have an agreement upon what is in the identical ledger. 
  - In order for the blocks to be added, all the nodes in the system come to agree as to what transactions are accurate and should be added to the chain of blocks. 
  - Since there is no central authority telling the nodes which transactions are valid, a new way to reach agreement or come to *consensus* is needed.
- Encryption
  - assure the information on the blockchain is authentic
  - Cryptography and blockchain offer a secure way to prove something is authentic. Instead of relying on third-party, trust is put into cryptographic algorithms that prove the provenance and authenticity of an attestation.
- Immutability
  - Cryptography also plays a part in another powerful feature of blockchain technology, immutability. 
  - What makes blockchain incredibly powerful is that all the blocks are linked together. 
  - With the use of a cryptographic technique called hashing, the linked information is forged so that if you go back and try to change any data on any block anywhere in the shared ledger, the link with the other copies is broken in a very obvious and easy-to-determine way
- Programable
  - Some blockchains offer an additional feature, *smart contracts*, that impose logic into the system
  - you can think of these blockchains as computers
  - The first of these blockchains is Ethereum
  - Ethereum runs the EVM, Ethereum Virtual Machine, which has the ability to impose digital agreements or smart contracts. A smart contract is a program that runs on a blockchain that can impose contractual agreements. Typically, they work as digital agreements that enforce a specific set of rules. These rules are predefined by computer code, which is replicated and executed by all network nodes. Blockchain smart contracts allow for the creation of trustless protocols. This means that two parties can make commitments via blockchain, without having to know or trust each other. They can be sure that if the conditions aren't fulfilled, the contract won't be executed. Other than that, the use of smart contracts can remove the need for intermediaries, reducing operational costs significantly.





## 2. Blockchain Mechanics



### Understanding Ledgers

- **Ethereum**
  Ethereum, like Bitcoin, is a decentralized open-source blockchain. Unlike the Bitcoin Network, the Ethereum Protocol has the ability to run smart contracts. The cryptocurrency running on the Ethereum network is called Ether.
- **Smart Contracts**
  A smart contract is computer code that can be run on a blockchain that executes the conditions of an agreement.
- **Public Blockchains**
  A public blockchain has no barrier to entry. Anyone with a cell phone and a digital wallet can transact on the blockchain.
- **Private Blockchains**
  Private blockchains or permissioned blockchains have a Membership Services piece that grants access to users before they can interact with the blockchain.
- **Digital Wallet**
  A digital wallet is a computer application that represents a traditional wallet. It gives the user the ability to store and transact cryptocurrencies through the Internet.
- **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**
  Public Key Infrastructure is the identity management system for instilling trust into the electronic transfers of information or value. It is the technology used to authenticate users and information by issuing a set of key pairs (public and private).



The Ledger

Distributed Ledger Technology is another way to refer to the blockchain. A Ledger is a record of the movement of assets; it is not a collection of assets but a recording of the transactions affecting the assets.



Basic Accounting Systems 

Basic Accounting Systems have acceptable practices in place based on the General Ledger”



Single Entry Ledger

- a one sided entry in either the credit or the debit column
- Single-entry only.
- created the first documented accounting standards.



Double Entry Ledger

- tracks debits and credits.
- Tells the story of a transaction from both/all sides.



Triple Entry Accounting

Instead of keeping separate records based on transaction receipts, companies can write their transactions directly into a joint register, creating an interlocking system of enduring accounting records

Since all entries are distributed and cryptographically sealed, falsifying or destroying them to conceal activity is practically impossible.

- tracks debits and credits.
- Tells the story of a transaction from both/all sides.
- Distributed Ledger Record

Decentralized Ledger

we are entering a new phase where no one centralized authority has control of the details in the ledger; everyone does.

Once consensus is reached, no one can go back and deny a transaction

Start of transcript. Skip to the end.
As you start to get more and more into blockchain, one term that you're gonna hear a lot is Byzantine Fault Tolerance.
And if you're wondering what that means, that very strange, cryptic sounding term, that can be explained with a story.
In 1982, a mathematical problem was formulated called the Byzantine Generals Problem,
and without getting too detailed into the mathematics behind it,
essentially, with the Byzantine Generals Problem was a story about two empires fighting a battle.
One Empire exists within the confines of a walled city, the second Empire has several generals surrounding that walled city, each with their armies waiting to attack.
And the balance of power is very, very evenly matched between these two empires.
And it is such that if all the generals agree to attack at the same time, they will have enough power to overcome the empire in the city and win the campaign.
If they, for whatever reason, they're not able to coordinate their attacks simultaneously, and even one general misses the message,
well then, the Empire surrounding the walled city is going to lose the campaign and the war.
So, the Byzantine Generals Problem explored a really key area of cryptography, in fact, the heart of what cryptography is,
which is how do I exchange messages with someone in an environment where they may become corrupt.
You have to understand the only way these generals had to communicate was to send a disguised messenger through the city with a message to deliver to the other generals,
and so, this always posed the risk, if you're a general and you're getting amessage from one of these messengers,
how do you know or how can you believe with greater than random certainty that the message you're getting is reliable and it hasn't been tampered with.
And this, again, was a problem that was postulated back in 1982 and went unsolved until 2008,
when the anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto proposed a solution to this problem.
Essentially, what the solution entails is all of the generals hiring as many mathematicians as they can.
When we talk about Byzantine Fault Tolerance, we're talking about the generals having more access, having more mathematicians, or more computing power on their side than the empire within the city.
So, if I'm the generals and I can hire more mathematicians, then that means that I can encrypt my messages going through the city with greater and greater complexity,
and if the balance of power becomes greatly tipped in the favor of the generals outside the city,
they can use encryption methods which are so complex, that there really is no real chance, or a very small chance that any of the mathematicians inside the city will be able to intercept that message,
decrypt it, change the contents, re-encrypt it, and do so in a time quick enough that the generals don't notice anything has happened.
And so, this is Byzantine Fault Tolerance.
This is the fault tolerance mechanism that we see used in most public blockchain solutions right now,
including Bitcoin, including Ethereum, although Ethereum is working on transitioning to a system called Proof of Stake, which we'll talk about in a later section.
But, when you hear Byzantine Fault Tolerance, often abbreviated as BFT,
all we're talking about is this idea that blockchains become secure if they have more computing power, more hash power in the chain than off the chain.
So, solutions like Ethereum, 16,000 plus nodes, or Bitcoin, the largest blockchain network that there is, with over 30,000 nodes,
offer us a high degree of security and immutability,
because the computing power on those networks is so great that there's really no reasonable chance that an adversary could ever control as much or more computing power to attack the data on that blockchain.
And if someone ever were to, chances are the economics behind it would be such that they would spend more to simultaneously harness all that computing power,
than they could possibly stand to gain.
And so, this is Byzantine Fault Tolerance.
It is the root of cryptography, which is simply the study of how do we send information back and forth securely in the presence of adversaries and bad actors,
and it's what underlies all the security and immutability that we get in blockchain.

- **Public Key Cryptography**
  This encryption method uses a pair of keys: an encryption key, and a decryption key, named public key and private key, respectively. The key pair generated by this algorithm consists of a private key and a unique public key that is generated using the same algorithm.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**
  A new approach to protecting digital secrets that prove knowledge of a secret without revealing it.
- **Hash Functions**
  This type of encryption doesn’t make use of keys. It uses a cipher to generate a hash value of a fixed length. The function converts plain text (no matter the size) into a hash of fixed size. It is nearly impossible for the contents of plain text to be recovered from the cipher text. 
- **Merkle Trees**
  A data storage technique that compresses or packs data for storing blockchains with a tamper-free component built in. Merkle trees are built upon hashing principles in that each hash becomes a part of the next hash to build a tamper-resistant data storage model.



Identity in the blockchain is based on public key cryptography. A person’s address on the blockchain is their public key.

Transactions on the blockchain include their public key and are digitally signed with the sender’s private key:

- A digital signature verifies that someone in possession of the private key authorized the transaction.
- Digital signatures can be easily verified using the corresponding public key, which is included in the transaction.

In blockchain, with cryptocurrencies, it's a little bit different.
The only thing that ever gets kept in here is your private key.
And a private key - public key work together so that I can use a private key to sign, digitally sign, any message.
You can then take the public key, which anyone can know, and use that to verify that my specific private key was the one that actually signed that message.
And so, you can know without a doubt that I'm the one who created that message,
that no one was pretending to be me sending this message.
And this is how it works trading digital currencies back and forth.
If I decide I'm going to pay you three bitcoins and I'm gonna do it out of this hardware wallet or any software wallet, any kind of digital currency,
the only thing that's kept on this device is my private key and it never leaves,
and so, that means if I want to send you some money, all I'm doing is accessing the private key on this device to sign a message that gets transmitted to the blockchain,
that says I'm paying you some bitcoin or some ether or some litecoin,
and my public key is used to verify that that message actually did come from the wallet that says it did.
And this is how we trade cryptocurrencies back and forth,
and that's what makes the concept of a digital wallet a little bit different.
If I happen to lose this, I haven't lost the money that's in it, because there's no money ever in it.
All that money is is just a record on the blockchain, and, as long as I can recover that private key somehow, I can just get a new device,
start using my private key again and keep right on trading.
So, that's how public and private keys fit into blockchain; a very key component just to understand that they're used to sign and verify any transactions that you make.

```





Zero-Knowldege Proof(ZKP)

A zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) is a cryptographic method that allows a party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) that a given statement is true without conveying any additional information.



```
This simple cave door analogy is a Zero-Knowledge proof, and if you can remember this cave door analogy,
then you'll understand why Zero-Knowledge Proofs are so important in blockchain.
For example, a user may make a request to send another user some money.
The blockchain naturally wants to make sure, before it commits this transaction,
that the user sending the money has enough to send.
However, the blockchain doesn't really need to know or care who is spending the money, or how much total money they have.
Being able to answer a question of "Does a user have enough money to send to another user" without knowing who the user is, or exactly how much they have,
is one of the primary use cases for Zero-Knowledge Proofs in blockchain.
So, when you hear about zk-SNARKs, don't get intimidated.
It's not a complex idea. Just think of Zero-Knowledge Proofs and the cave door,
think about how important it is in blockchain to be able to prove a claim without actually revealing the information behind that claim,
and you'll understand Zero-Knowledge Proofs.

```



Hash Functions in Blockchain

With data integrity guaranteed by algorithms, trust becomes part of the system.

Hash functions are featured heavily in blockchain. A hash function is a mathematical equation with four important properties:

1. Hash functions can take anything as input and create an output with a fixed size. This makes it possible to condense anything into a piece of data of a fixed size and is how messages are condensed for digital signatures.
2. It’s easy to calculate a hash but hard to determine a hash input from the output. The best option is to keep trying inputs until one produces the desired output.
3. Inputs that differ by a single bit produce hashes that differ by half of their bits on average. This prevents someone from finding a desired hash input using a “hill climbing”.
4. It is infeasible to find two inputs that produce the same output when hashed. Since a hash can take any input and produce a fixed output, it makes sense that multiple different inputs will create the same output. A good hash function will make it so that you have to try a large number of inputs before finding two that produce the same output.

**Merkle Tree**

A special type of data storage structure based on hash functions is called a *Merkle tree*:

- It is structured as a binary tree; the leaves contain the values to be stored, and each internal node is the hash of its two children.

```
Let's say Alice wants to validate transaction "F".
Alice would only need to send the data of transaction "F" and four hash values to Bob.
Bob would then calculate the hash value based on the given information.
And if the root matches the block, the transaction can be assumed to be valid.
Merkle trees allow for validation of a specific transaction without requiring the entire set of data.

Key Management

 Public key cryptography is used in the blockchain as a method for managing users’ identities without revealing real-world identities.

In Ethereum, users are identified by an address that is directly related to the user's public key. This provides identity verification while preserving anonymity.





### [Transparency and Immutability](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS170x+1T2023/block-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS170x+1T2023+type@sequential+block@b2327e4750bc4beda267bf03132fbe6c)

Blockchain offers efficiency. It also creates trust and financial benefit through transparency, security, immutability, and accessibility through ownership.



Traditional databases do not retain historical information:

- Only the most recent versions of each value are visible.
- Deleted values are not visible in the database.
- This limits the transparency of data contained in the database.
- Values can be modified or deleted after creation.

The CRUD update model of databases allows data to be changed or removed from the database. This means that the visible data in a database is not an accurate historical record of the database.



The blockchain is designed to be a data structure that only allows appending:

- The past history of the blockchain is visible and immutable.
- Updates to the blockchain can be performed by including them in new blocks added to the blockchain.

The blockchain is designed so that its entire history is visible and unchangeable.

```
The way immutability works is blockchain is, by design, a very, very inefficient solution.
We are asking a large number of nodes, all the nodes on a network, to perform exactly the same work as every other node.
So, essentially, we are duplicating work over and over and over again.
The reason we do this, is because the only way to potentially change data on a blockchain,
is by changing the record on that blockchain for 51% or more of the nodes, or the miners, or the participants trying to come to consensus on the blockchain.

understand that we only have two possible operations on blockchain: we can only read data and we can only add new data.
There's no concept of an edit or delete, and this is what we talk about when we talk about immutability on the blockchain.

```



The blockchain is designed so that immutability is cumulative; each piece is linked to every other piece, creating a cohesive whole that is more difficult for an attacker to modify.

- At the bottom level, transactions are digitally signed by their creators. An attacker can’t forge a transaction unless they steal a private key.
- A block structure is predefined. Attackers can’t modify it to suit their purposes.
- The chain part of the blockchain is achieved using hash functions. Each block includes the hash of the previous block, creating a clear link between each block in the blockchain.
- Each block is digitally signed by its creator. The creator is selected through the blockchain’s consensus protocol, making it difficult for an attacker to be a legitimate creator.

All four of these features help to make the blockchain resistant against changes occurring after the fact.



```

Because this hash is the output of input to a hash function consisting not only of the transaction data, but also of the nonce, changing either one will result in a new hash output which does not match the difficulty.


all it has to do is simply share this nonce value with every other node on the network.

In this way, all nodes can come to consensus or agreement on what the right set of transaction data should be.
When a node thinks it's guessed the right nonce, it simply shares that value with the rest of the network.
If the majority of the network, 51% or more, agree with this nonce, because they have the same transaction data on their copy of the block,
then the miner who guessed this number first, will be rewarded and the network will come to consensus or agree that this is the correct version of the block data.
```
