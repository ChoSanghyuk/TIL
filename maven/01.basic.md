# Maven Basic



### What is maven

- Build Tool
- Dependency Management
- Repository system
- Plugin framework
- Best Practices



### Reason Why Using Command Line

- provide common interface
- online help
- good learning tool
  - can know what's going on
- provides debugging / troubleshooting



### Core Concepts

- Convention over Configuration
- Project Object Model (POM)
- Dependency Resolution
- Maven Repository
- Lifecycle, Phases, and Goals
- Plugin Architecture



### Convention Over Configuration

- approach that can provide useful functionality with little / no configuration
- achieved by pre-scripted conventions
- Best Practices
- Reasonable Defaults
  - 패키지 구조
- Override when required



### Project Object Model

- Object-based representation of a build
- `pom.xml`
- Project meta data
  - coordinates (Group, Artifact, Version)
- dependencies
- Build settings
- Inheritance / Super POM



### Dependencies

- Declare primary dependencies

- Transitive dependencies

  - dependency of your dependency 까지 download

- Downloading from repository

- Caching locally

- Scopes ( compile time vs runtime)

  - dependency가 언제 필요한지 정의

  

### Maven Repositories

- Artifact Storage
- Standard layout
- local or remote
- central (many open source projects)
- private (corporate)
- used by others (gradle , Ivy)



### Maven Building Blocks

- Goals
  - Tasks that do the work
  - Defined By plugins
- Phases
  - one or many goals
  - Part of lifecycle
- Lifecycle
  - start to finish collection of phases
  - different based on packaging type
  - executes all phases up to specific phase



### Plugins

- Nearly everything is a plugin
- Extends Maven
- More Goals
- Dependencies



LifeCycle contains phases.

phases are mapped to goals
