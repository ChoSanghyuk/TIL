### Ubuntu Prometheus 설치

- 설치 : `sudo apt install prometheus`
  - 에러 시 `sudo apt update` 후 진행
- 상태 확인 : `sudo service prometheus status`



prometheus service -> Node Exporter 





## What is prometheus



### Monitoring Tool

- Highly dynamic container environments 
  - + Trandintional , bare server

=> Container & Microservices Infrastructure



## Where and why is prometheus used



### Monitoring on Container & Microservices Infrastructure

- Complex Infrastructure => one can crash and cause failure on others
  - Response Latency , Overloaded , Errrors, Hardware down , Enough resources
- Need to quickly identify what is going wrong
- 내부에서의 error chain을 알지 못하면 user는 단순히 기능이 작동 안하는 것으로 인식
  - 밖에서부터 한단계 씩 찾아가면 원인 파악 늦음
- constantly monitor all the services
- alert when crash
- identify problems before





## prometheus Architecture



### Main Component : prometheus Server

- does the actual monitoring work
- 구성
  - Retrieval
    - pulls metrics data
    - Data Retrieval Worker
  - Stroage
    - stores metrics data
  - HTTP Server
    - accepts queries



### Targets and Metrics

- What does prometheus  monitor
  - Linux/Windows Server
  - Apache Server
  - Single Application
  - Service, like database
- Which units are monitored of those targets
  - CPU Status
  - Memory/Disk Space Usage
  - Exceptions Count
  - Request Count
  - Request Duration



### Metrics

- Format : Human-readable test-based
- Metrics entries : TYPE and HELP attributes
  - HELP : description of what the metrics is
  - TYPE : 3 metrics types
    - Counter  : how many tiems x happend
    - Gauge : what is current value of x 
    - Histogram : how long and how big



### Collecting Metrics Data from targets

- Data Retrieval Worker

  - pulls over HTTP   =target=> Linux Server

    ​							   =target=> External Service

- 작동
  - Pulls from HTTP endpoints
  - hostaddress / metrics
  - must be in correct format



### Exporter

- Some services has exposing/metrics endpoints by default But many need another component

  => Exporter

- 작동

  - Target : some service
    1. fetch metrics
    2. converts to correct format
    3. expose metriccs
  - Retrival : pull metrics data





### pull system : more advantages (vs push systme)

- multiple prometheus instances can pull metrics data
- better detection / insight if service is up and running
- vs push
  - 여러 service가 한 곳의 server에 push : high load of network traffic
  - monitoring can become your bottlenetck



### 추가 Architecture

- Alert Manager
  - rule mets => alert fired

- Promethueus Data Storage
  - Local Disk (HDD/SSD)
  - Remote Storage Systems

- Quering Promethueus 
  - PromQL

  - Query target directly 
    - Complex & not well documented

  - Or use more powerful visualization tools : grafana



## Example Configuration



### Configuring prometheus 

- How prometheus know what to scrape and when

  : prometheus .yml



### Sample

```yml
global:
	scrape_interval: 15s
	evaluation_interval : 15s
rule_files:
	- "first.rules"
	- "second.rules"

scrape_configs:
	- job_name: promethueus
	  static_configs:
	  	- targets: ['localhost:9090']
```

- interval
  - how often Promethueus will scrape its targets
- Rules
  - aggregating metrics values or creating alerts when condition met
- configs
  - what resources Promethueus monitors







## Key Characteristics



###  Characteristics

- 장점

  - reliable
    - when other system go wrongs , diagnose and fix it


  - stand-alone and self-containing


  - works even if other parts of infrasture broken


  - no extensive setup needed

- 단점

  - difficult to scale

  - limits monitoring

    => Workarounds: increase  Prometheus server capacity / limit number of metrics
