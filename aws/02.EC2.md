# EC2



## AWS Budge Setup

1. 루트 계정 > 내 계정 > 결제 정보에 대한 IAM 사용자 및 역할 액세스 - 편집 > IAM 엑세스 활성화 클릭 > 업데이트
2. 서브 계정 > 내 결제 대시보드 > 청구서 => 비용 청구 내역 확인 or  Budget => 예산 설정



## EC2 Overview

### EC2

- Elastic Compute Cloud = Infrastructure as a Service
- consists in the capability of
  - Renting virtual machines (EC2)
  - Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
  - Distributing load across machines (ELB)
  - Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)



### EC2 sizing & configuration options

- OS : Linux, Windows, Mac OS
- CPU
- RAM
- Storage space
  - Network-attached (EBS & EFS)
  - hardware (EC2 Instance Store)
- Network card : speed of the card, Public IP address
- Firewall rules : **security group**
- Bootstrap script : EC2 User Data



### EC2 User Data

- bootstrap our instances using an EC2 User Data script
  - bootstrap : launching commands when a machine starts
- only **run once** at the instance **first start**
- is used to automate boot tasks such as
  - Installing updates
  - Installing software
  - Downloading common files from the interest
  - Anything you can think of
- The EC2 User Data Script runs with the root user



## EC2 Instance



### Launch EC2 Instance

- Name
  - tag 값에서 key, value 에서 (name, 실제 이름)
- Key pair
  - 해당 instance 접근하기 위한 key 값. 다운로드 후 분실 주의



### EC2 Instance 관리

- 언제든지 실행, 중지, 제거 가능
- Instance 중지 후 재실행하면 public ip 주소 변경 됨



## EC2 Instance Types

### EC2 Instance Types

- 종류
  - General Purpose
  - Compute Optimized
  - Memory Optimized
  - Accelerated Computing
  - Storage Optimized
  - Instance Features
  - Measuring Instance Performance
- Naming Convention
  - `<instance class>` `<generation>`.`<size within the instance class>`
  - ex) m5.2xlarge



### General Purpose

- Great for a diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories
- Balance between `Compute`, `Memory`, `Networking`



### Compute Optimized

- Great for compute-intensive tasks that require high performance processors
- Use cases
  - Bach processing workloads
  - Media transcoding
  - High performance web servers
  - High performance computing
  - Scientific modeling & machine learning
  - Dedicated gaming servers



### Memory Optimized

- Fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory
- Use cases
  - High performance, relational/non-relational databases
  - Distributed web scale cache stores
  - In-memory databases optimized for BI (Business Intelligence)
  - Applications performing real-time processing of big unstructured data



### Storage Optimized

- Great for storage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage
- Use cases
  - High frequency online transaction processing systems (OLTP)
  - Relation & NoSQL databases
  - Cache for in-memory databases
  - Data warehousing applications
  - Distributed file systems



## Security Groups & Class Ports



### Security Groups

- fundamental of network security in AWS
- control how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 instances
- `only contain allow rules`
- securuity groups rules can reference by IP or security group

- acting as a `firewall` on EC2 instances : regulate
  - Access to Ports
  - Authorized IP ranges
  - Control of inbound network ( instance <= other )
  - Control of outbound network ( intance => outher )



### Security Groups Tip

- can be attached to multiple instances
- Locked down to a region /VPC combination
- live 'outside' the EC2 : traffic is blocked => EC2 instacne won't see it
- `good to maintain one seperate security group for SSH access`
- 오류 코드
  - application is not accessible => security group issue
  - application gives connection refused => application error or not launched
- default traffic policy
  - inbound traffic is blocked
  - outbound traffic is authorized



### Class Ports

- 22 : SSH (Secure Shell). log into a Linux instacne
- 21 : FTP (File Transfer Protocol). upload files into a file share
- 22 : SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol). upload files using SSH
- 80 : HTTP. access unsecured websites
- 443 : HTTPS. access secured websites
- 3389 : RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol). log into a Windows instance



## SSH



### Using SSH on Windows 10

1. EC2 instance의 identity 파일 있어야 함 (instance 생성시 다운받은 pem 파일)

2. PowerShell > ssh => ssh 존재 확인

3. PowerSheel > ssh -i 'pem파일 경로' ec2-user@'instance의 publid ip'

   @ 만약 오류시 => pem 파일 속성 =>  보안 => 고급 => 소유자 나로 변경 및 다른 유저 권한 삭제

4. ctrl + d => logout
