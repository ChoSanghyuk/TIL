# EC2



## AWS Budge Setup

1. 루트 계정 > 내 계정 > 결제 정보에 대한 IAM 사용자 및 역할 액세스 - 편집 > IAM 엑세스 활성화 클릭 > 업데이트
2. 서브 계정 > 내 결제 대시보드 > 청구서 => 비용 청구 내역 확인 or  Budget => 예산 설정



## EC2 Overview

### EC2

- Elastic Compute Cloud = Infrastructure as a Service
- consists in the capability of
  - Renting virtual machines (EC2)
  - Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
  - Distributing load across machines (ELB)
  - Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)



### EC2 sizing & configuration options

- OS : Linux, Windows, Mac OS
- CPU
- RAM
- Storage space
  - Network-attached (EBS & EFS)
  - hardware (EC2 Instance Store)
- Network card : speed of the card, Public IP address
- Firewall rules : **security group**
- Bootstrap script : EC2 User Data



### EC2 User Data

- bootstrap our instances using an EC2 User Data script
  - bootstrap : launching commands when a machine starts
- only **run once** at the instance **first start**
- is used to automate boot tasks such as
  - Installing updates
  - Installing software
  - Downloading common files from the interest
  - Anything you can think of
- The EC2 User Data Script runs with the root user



## EC2 Instance



### Launch EC2 Instance

- Name
  - tag 값에서 key, value 에서 (name, 실제 이름)
- Key pair
  - 해당 instance 접근하기 위한 key 값. 다운로드 후 분실 주의



### EC2 Instance 관리

- 언제든지 실행, 중지, 제거 가능
- Instance 중지 후 재실행하면 public ip 주소 변경 됨



## EC2 Instance Types

### EC2 Instance Types

- 종류
  - General Purpose
  - Compute Optimized
  - Memory Optimized
  - Accelerated Computing
  - Storage Optimized
  - Instance Features
  - Measuring Instance Performance
- Naming Convention
  - `<instance class>` `<generation>`.`<size within the instance class>`
  - ex) m5.2xlarge



### General Purpose

- Great for a diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories
- Balance between `Compute`, `Memory`, `Networking`



### Compute Optimized

- Great for compute-intensive tasks that require high performance processors
- Use cases
  - Bach processing workloads
  - Media transcoding
  - High performance web servers
  - High performance computing
  - Scientific modeling & machine learning
  - Dedicated gaming servers



### Memory Optimized

- Fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory
- Use cases
  - High performance, relational/non-relational databases
  - Distributed web scale cache stores
  - In-memory databases optimized for BI (Business Intelligence)
  - Applications performing real-time processing of big unstructured data



### Storage Optimized

- Great for storage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage
- Use cases
  - High frequency online transaction processing systems (OLTP)
  - Relation & NoSQL databases
  - Cache for in-memory databases
  - Data warehousing applications
  - Distributed file systems



## Security Groups & Class Ports



### Security Groups

- fundamental of network security in AWS
- control how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 instances
- **only contain allow rules**
- securuity groups rules can reference by IP or security group

- acting as a `firewall` on EC2 instances : regulate
  - Access to Ports
  - Authorized IP ranges
  - Control of inbound network ( instance <= other )
  - Control of outbound network ( intance => outher )



### Security Groups Tip

- can be attached to multiple instances
- Locked down to a region /VPC combination
- live 'outside' the EC2 : traffic is blocked => EC2 instacne won't see it
- **good to maintain one seperate security group for SSH access**
- 오류 코드
  - application is not accessible => security group issue
  - application gives connection refused => application error or not launched
- default traffic policy
  - inbound traffic is blocked
  - outbound traffic is authorized



### Class Ports

- 22 : SSH (Secure Shell). log into a Linux instacne
- 21 : FTP (File Transfer Protocol). upload files into a file share
- 22 : SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol). upload files using SSH
- 80 : HTTP. access unsecured websites
- 443 : HTTPS. access secured websites
- 3389 : RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol). log into a Windows instance



## SSH



### Using SSH on Windows 10

1. EC2 instance의 identity 파일 있어야 함 (instance 생성시 다운받은 pem 파일)

2. PowerShell > ssh => ssh 존재 확인

3. PowerSheel > ssh -i 'pem파일 경로' ec2-user@'instance의 publid ip'

   @ 만약 오류시 => pem 파일 속성 =>  보안 => 고급 => 소유자 나로 변경 및 다른 유저 권한 삭제

4. ctrl + d => logout



### EC2 instance connect

- aws 페이지에서 instance 연결하는 방법
- EC2 instance => 연결 => EC2 인스턴스 연결 => 연결



## EC2 Instance Roles



### EC2 Instance Roles

- EC2 Instance와 연결하여 작업을 할 때 절대로 `aws configure`을 통해서 계정 정보 입력 x

  => 다른 EC2 Instance 사용자가 해당 정보 접근

- EC2를 통해 작업 할 때에는 EC2 Instance에 IAM Role을 추가해서 권한 부여 후 사용

- 부여 방법

  1. EC2 Instance => 작업 => 보안 => IAM 역할 수정



## EC2 Instances Purchasing Options



### On-Demand Instances

- Pay for what you use

  - Linux : 첫 1분 후, 초단위 계산
  - Other : 1시간 단위 계산

- Has the hightest cost but no upfront payment

- No long-term commitment

  => Recommended for `short-term` and `un-interrrupted workloads` when unpredictable



### Reserved

- ~ 72% DC to On-Demand
- Reservation period : 1년 시 할인 < 3년 시 할인
- Puchasing options : no upfront, partial upfront, All upfront (즉시 낼 수록 할인율 up)
- Reserve a specific instance type
- Recommended for steady-state usage applications
- 종류
  - Convertible Reserved Instance
    - ~45% DC
  - Scheduled Reserved Instances
    - launch within time window you reserve
    - Commitment for 1 year only



### Spot Instances

- ~ 90% DC

- Instances that you can `lose` at ay point of time if your max price is less than the current spot price

- Most cost-efficient instances

  => Useful for workloads that are resilient to failure

  - Batch jobs
  - Data analysis
  - Any distributed workloads

  `Not suitable for critical jobs and databases`

  

### Dedicated Hosts

- phisical server whie EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use.

- can help you address `compliance requirements` and reduce costs by allowing you to `use your existing server-bound software licenses`

- Allocated for your account for a 3-year period reservation

- More expensive

  => Useful for

  - software that have complicated licensing model
  - companies that have strong regulatory or compliance needs



### Dedicated Instances

- Instances running on hadware that's dedicated to you
- May share hardware with other instances in same account
- No control over instance placement



## Shared Responsiblity Model for EC2

| aws                                                          | user                                                         |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| - Infrastructure<br />- Isolatioin on physical hosts<br />- Replacing faulty hadware<br />- Compliance validation | - Security Groups rules<br />- Operating-system patches and updates-<br />- Software and utilities installed on the EC2 instance<br />- IAM Roles assigned to EC2 & IAM user access management<br />- Data security on your instances |
