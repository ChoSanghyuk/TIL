# EC2 Instance Storage



## EBS



### EBS Volume Overview

- is a network drive you can attach to your instances while they run
- it allows your instances to persist data, even after their termination
- only be mounted to one instacne at a time (at CCP level)
- bound to a specific availability zone
- Free tier : 30GB of free EBS Storage of type General Purpose(SSD) of Magnetic per month



### EBS Volume

- network drive
  - it uses the network to communicate the instance ( 지연 有 )
  - can be detached from an EC2 instance and attached to another one quickly
- locked to an Availability Zone (AZ)
  - EBS Volume in us-east-l a cannot be attached us-east-l b
  - to move a volume across, you first need to snapshot it
- have a provisioned capacity (size in GBs, and IOPS)
  - you get billed for all the provisioned capacity
  - you can increase the capacity of the drive over time



### EBS - Delete on Termination attribute

- Controls the EBS behavior when an EC2 instance terminates
  - By default, the root EBS volume is deleted( attribute enabled )
  - By default, any other attached EBS volume is not deleted( attribute disabled )

- This can be controlled by the AWS console / AWS CLI
- User case : preserve root volume when instance is terminated



### EBS Volume 실습

- EC2 => 인스턴스 클릭 => 스토리지 => 볼륨 id 클릭
- 볼륨 생성 => 생성
- 볼륨 위에서 우클릭 => 삭제, 연결 등 작업 가능



## EBS Snapshots



### EBS Snapshots

- Make a backup(snapshot) of your EBS volume at at point in time
- Not necessary to detach volume to do snapshot, but recommended
- Can copy snapshots across AZ or Region



### EBS Snapshots 실습

- EC2 => 인스턴스 클릭 => 스토리지 => 볼륨 id 클릭 => 작업 => 스냇샵 생성
- 왼쪽 바 => Elastic Block Store => 스냅샷 
  - 확인
  - Actions => copy, create volume (스냅샷 정보 들고 있는)
