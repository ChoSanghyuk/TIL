Javaâ„¢ database connectivity (JDBC) is the JavaSoft specification of a standard application programming interface (API) that allows Java programs to access database management systems. The JDBC API consists of a set of interfaces and classes written in the Java programming language.

 Using the JDBC API, you can access virtually any data source, from relational databases to spreadsheets and flat files. JDBC technology also provides a common base on which tools and alternate interfaces can be built.

The JDBC API is comprised of two packages:

- [`java.sql`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/sql/package-summary.html)
- [`javax.sql`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/sql/package-summary.html)

You automatically get both packages when you download the Java Platform Standard Edition (Java SE) 8.

 To use the JDBC API with a particular database management system, you need a JDBC technology-based driver to mediate between JDBC technology and the database. 

Using these standard interfaces and classes, programmers can write applications that connect to databases, send queries written in structured query language (SQL), and process the results.

Since JDBC is a standard specification, one Java program that uses the JDBC API can connect to any database management system (DBMS), as long as a driver exists for that particular DBMS.



import java.sql.PreparedStatement





### Class.forName()

When you use `Class.forName()` to load a JDBC driver, you are making the driver's implementation class available to the JVM, so that it can be used to establish a database connection using the `DriverManager` class.

When you load a driver using `Class.forName()`, it registers the driver with the `DriverManager`, so that it becomes available for use in establishing connections to a particular type of database.

JDBC drivers to be automatically loaded and registered with the `DriverManager` based on the contents of the JDBC URL.







### Connection Poll

The `DriverManager` class in Java does not provide built-in support for connection pooling. The `DriverManager` class is a basic utility class that provides a way to register and manage JDBC drivers and establish database connections, but it does not offer advanced features like connection pooling.

To implement connection pooling in a Java application, you would typically need to use a third-party library or a connection pooling framework that provides the necessary features. 



Sure! Here are some official documentation links that provide more information about JDBC and the service provider mechanism:

### connection pool



If we analyze the sequence of steps involved in a typical database connection life cycle, we'll understand why:

1. Opening a connection to the database using the database driver
2. Opening a [TCP socket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_socket) for reading/writing data
3. Reading / writing data over the socket
4. Closing the connection
5. Closing the socket

It becomes evident that **database connections are fairly expensive operations**, and as such, should be reduced to a minimum in every possible use case (in edge cases, just avoided).

By just simply implementing a database connection container, which allows us to reuse a number of existing connections, we can effectively save the cost of performing a huge number of expensive database trips. 

This boosts the overall performance of our database-driven applications.



##### **3.2. HikariCP**

Now let's look at [HikariCP](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP), a lightning-fast JDBC connection pooling framework created by [Brett Wooldridge](https://github.com/brettwooldridge) (for the full details on how to configure and get the most out of HikariCP, please check out[ this article](https://www.baeldung.com/hikaricp)):

```java
public class HikariCPDataSource {
    
    private static HikariConfig config = new HikariConfig();
    private static HikariDataSource ds;
    
    static {
        config.setJdbcUrl("jdbc:h2:mem:test");
        config.setUsername("user");
        config.setPassword("password");
        config.addDataSourceProperty("cachePrepStmts", "true");
        config.addDataSourceProperty("prepStmtCacheSize", "250");
        config.addDataSourceProperty("prepStmtCacheSqlLimit", "2048");
        ds = new HikariDataSource(config);
    }
    
    public static Connection getConnection() throws SQLException {
        return ds.getConnection();
    }
    
    private HikariCPDataSource(){}
}Copy
```

Similarly, here's how to get a pooled connection with the *HikariCPDataSource* class:

```java
Connection con = HikariCPDataSource.getConnection();
```
